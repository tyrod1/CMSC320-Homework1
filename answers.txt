What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

The difference between a merge and a rebase is that in a merge the merging braches final commit gets pointed to by thet last of the other branch. This perserves the entire history of commits. In a rebase, the entire branch is attached to the end of the other branch creating a linear history of commits but can overwriteupdates made on the original branch that is being added to.
